2025-02-10: Configured Next.js for GitHub Pages deployment
- Updated next.config.mjs: added output: 'export', basePath: '/valentines-site', images.unoptimized: true
- Created .nojekyll file to prevent Jekyll from ignoring _next folder
- Next steps: Set GitHub Pages source to GitHub Actions, add workflow that builds and deploys from out/ folder

2025-02-10: Added GitHub Actions workflow (was missing - this caused dynamic build)
- Created .github/workflows/deploy.yml: runs pnpm build (static export) and deploys out/ via actions/deploy-pages
- Workflow copies .nojekyll into out/ before upload so _next folder is served
- Must set GitHub Settings > Pages > Source = GitHub Actions (and create github-pages environment if prompted)
